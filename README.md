I am an MCA final semester student with hands-on experience in mobile application development using **Flutter** and **Android (Kotlin)**, backed by **Firebase** services.

I have worked on real-world, project-based applications involving user authentication, role-based access, business workflows, and data-driven features.

Alongside mobile development, I am currently exploring the fundamentals of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** through a structured internship under the **Edunet Foundation – IBM SkillBuild program**.
